*** IMPORTANT ***
- Training data could not be included due to it's size (sorry Joe), to give you an estimate on how long it takes to train, it took me about 5 hours on my computer (10% every half hour). 

*** INFORMATION ***
- py/ and js/ are 2 DIFFERENT bots, the one contained in js/ is ran in Javascript and the one in py/ is run in Python.
- As of 6/25/2019 Chat Bot is only being developed in Python, I hope to create a JS version at some point in the future but don't keep your hopes up.
